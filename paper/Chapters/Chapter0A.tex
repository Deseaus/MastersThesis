%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\noindent This appendix contains screenshots of both the initial (before translating) and final (after translating) questionnaires that were given to the study's participants. For further details on the design of the questionnaires, please refer to \autoref{ch:questionnaires}.

\paragraph{Please Note:} Form navigation and interface elements, such as the ``Next'' and ``Submit'' buttons and ``Required*'' field, were shown in the language participants have their Google account set up in or, if they don't have one, in the browser's default language. The screenshots in this chapter show the navigation and interface elements in Swedish, but this varied for each participant.

\subsection{Screenshots}

\noindent The following are screenshots of the questionnaire that participants had to fill in after completing the translation tasks. Participants were shown a reminder (not seen in the following screeenshots) of the source texts they had translated to help job their memory.
