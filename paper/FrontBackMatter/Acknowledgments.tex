\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements section text

\noindent Many people deserve a big ``Thank you!'' for their help in one way or another. I'll mention a few so as not to keep readers too long from the rest of the thesis.

\medskip

\noindent Thank you:

\begin{itemize}
    \item First, to my supervisor Aarne Ranta for helpful and patient insight.

    \item Second, to all the participants in the case study who took the time to thoughtfully fill in the questionnaires and translate the texts.

    \item Last and perhaps most importantly, to all the people who asked what my thesis was about and gave me puzzled looks when I told them. After explaining it to each of them in a different way, hopefully the following pages will have found the ideal answer.
\end{itemize}
