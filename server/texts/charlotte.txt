Charlotte Gyllenhammar, born 1963, is a fine artist based in Stockholm, Sweden.
She began her career as a painter, but swiftly moved on to sculpture and installation after completing her studies at the Royal College of Art in London.
The work entitled <em>Die for You</em> was the first step in a progression of images and environments that invert perspective.
 For example, confinement and inversion are evident in her video/photographic series of suspended women entitled <em>Belle</em>, 1998, <em>Fall</em>, 1999, <em>Disobedience</em>, 1998, and more recently <em>Hang</em> 2006.
