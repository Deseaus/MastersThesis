Many of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his fear of spiders (many of these can be found in the 7th strip comic collection type book ); his hate of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; and his obsession with mailing Nermal to Abu Dhabi. 
Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of raisins and spinach), Garfield is particularly fond of lasagna; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish).
