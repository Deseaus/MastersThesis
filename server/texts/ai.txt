The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956.
In 1973 the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence.
Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 80s the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again.
This cycle of boom and bust, of "AI winters" and summers, continues to haunt the field.
